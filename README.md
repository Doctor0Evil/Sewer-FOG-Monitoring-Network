# Sewer-FOG-Monitoring-Network
Sewer-FOG-Monitoring-Network is structured as a production-grade C++/IoT project: clamp-on ultrasonic flow meters plus FOG probes feed edge nodes in manholes, which publish data to a cloud dashboard that computes eco-Karma from FOG mass loads and pushes predictive overflow alerts and chat-ready summaries.
